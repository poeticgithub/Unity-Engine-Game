# Gadaga (Educational Game)

•	Space shooter meant to be a didactic tool to help children learn the order of operations

•	Player has to solve math  problems, shoot correct answers and avoid collisions with incorrect ones 

•	Used the Unity Engine for the graphics, textures, and user interface; wrote the governing scripts in C#

## Getting Started

Install Unity Engine 

```
Inside Unity Engine, click on File, Open Scene, then click on "Start Menu.unity"

You can build the game for PC, Mac, or Linux in the Build Settings.
```


## Playing the game

Use the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the flying brain. Solve the arithmetic problem, playing careful attention to the order of operations.

Press the Spacebar to shoot a projectile at the correct answer. 

Try to avoid colliding with incorrect answers.

You have a limited supply of projectiles. If you keep shooting the incorrect answers, you will eventually become too demoralized to continue and will run out of projectiles.

On the other hand, if you shoot a correct answer, you instantly get a confidence boost, and will replenish a projectile. 

The more correct answers you shoot, the faster the thought bubbles will come down.
